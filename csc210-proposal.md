URWatchMyFish Project Proposal
URWatchMyFish is a website that connects people who would be willing to take care of a fish over christmas, spring, or thanksgiving break with someone who needs their fish taken care of. This site will include user account, profiles for owners and caretakers, messaging services, and rating services. 
Our target audience is UR Students who own a fish and won’t be able to take care of it for period of time, as well as students who will be on campus over break and want to babysit a fish during that time. During breaks, students with pet fish aren’t always able to take them home. This can be a problem for U of R pet owners. Sometimes, they need someone responsible to watch their treasured pet and don’t have a friend who is staying on campus during break. This service will match them with a student who is staying on campus and is willing to watch their pet. Once matched, students will be able to message each other to work out the details of  their arrangement. Owners can rate the caretaker’s performance so future patrons of URWatchMyFish can avoid bad service. 
We believe that this project will meet the minimum requirements. Users will be able to create an account as either a fishowner or a fish caretaker. The fishowner profile will contain information regarding the kind of fish, a detailed description of how to care for the fish, as well as a picture and the name of the fish. The caretaker profile will list the caretaker’s pet ownership experience, where they are located, how much time they have to dedicate to the fish. The server will hold this data. There will be separate pages displaying caretaker profiles and fishowner profiles, so that each can search through and match with the other (like tinder) .Students will be able to update their existing data by editing their profile description (caretaker and fishowner), include a new fish (owner), include a new requirements (caretaker), as well as other features. Users will be able to delete their accounts if they would no longer like to be apart of URWatchMyFish. We will employ Ajax or WebSocket to make our site update data without needing to be refreshed.
	This doesn’t exist and is a brand new service being brought to the U of R, so it is unique. This website will have a rating feature and will implement messaging between students who match on URWatchMyFish. Both of these features go above and beyond this project’s minimum requirements.
